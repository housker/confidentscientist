      <description>It was a long day and Sean really needed a cigarette, but then he thought back to Columbia&amp;rsquo;s AI bootcamp, and his classmates, who are also trying to quit, and he thought how disappointed they would be. Consequently he started drinking instead while cursing at Laith. &amp;ldquo;Why couldn&amp;rsquo;t I have been a dictator!&amp;rdquo; he shouted, shaking his fist in the air.</description>

      <description>The classmates I&amp;rsquo;m doing my final project with want to quit. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to train an LLM to translate text, and the dataset it too large for our CPU and RAM to handle. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to quit. Knowing what to do with large data sets is enormously important. I&amp;rsquo;ll give feedback that they ought to include that in the curriculum. So far neither the teacher nor the TAs know what to do, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure we can figure it out.</description>
